# Automatic-Speaker-Diarization
Automatic Speaker Diarization using various machine learning techniques

* CombinedMSL.py is the code for neural network. It involves TensorFlow  framework and svmkmeans.py is the code for SVM classifier and K-means clustering. Both are written in Python 3.5 to make it compatible with TensorFlow. Please run the codes in Python version 3.5.

* Store the wavfile and transcript text file in the same folder as the code or write the appropritate directory log in lines 40 and 56.

* In case you want to access TensorBoard, the code for summaries is already written and the directory is mentioned in line 245. Please change this according to your needs. TensorBoard is still under development for Windows and thus we were not able to access it. It is however possible for OS X which is available to you.
